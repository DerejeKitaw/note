> can delete committed data from Git, but the method you use depends on what you want to achieve. Here are several common scenarios: 

1. Delete the Last Commit 

If you want to remove the most recent commit: 

```bash 
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

--hard: This will delete the commit and all changes in that commit from your working directory. 

> If you want to keep the changes in your working directory, use --soft instead: 

```bash 
git reset --soft HEAD~1 
```

2. Remove Specific Commits 

If you want to remove a specific commit from the history: 

Use an interactive rebase: 

```bash 
git rebase -i HEAD~n 
```

Replace n with the number of commits back you want to edit. This will open an editor where you can choose to drop the specific commit you want to remove. 

Save and close the editor to apply the changes. 

3. Delete a File from a Commit 

If you want to remove a specific file from a commit: 

```bash 
git rm --cached <file> 
git commit --amend
```

This will remove the file from the commit while keeping it in your working directory. 

4. Force Push (if necessary) 

If you have already pushed your changes to a remote repository, you'll need to force push the changes: 

```bash 
git push origin <branch-name> --force 
``` 

Caution 

Be Careful: Deleting commits can rewrite history, which can be problematic if you are working in a shared repository. Communicate with your team before performing such actions. 

Back Up: It's always a good idea to back up your repository before making significant changes. 

Summary 

Choose the method that best suits your needs based on what you want to delete. If you're uncertain, consider creating a backup branch before making any destructive changes.
